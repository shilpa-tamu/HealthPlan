# HealthPlan
Requirement gathering, Use case creation, ERD, Class Diagram

Objective: To design an efficient system that bolsters DGA Plans to collect funds from signatory companies for DGA Members 
covering their health insurance and pension benefits. The system should be able to define if any member is eligible to receive 
health benefits and formulate rules to check whether the member is eligible for plan renewal/plan change upon the expiry of 
the current plan.

Note: The ERD and the Class Diagram has been drawn using Draw.io. The XML files can be 'opened with' Draw.io.
